Pretty much to use it is to go to the following and have all node.js modules installed:

1. In the terminal, go to the jsv-cv-parser folder and input the following commands:
                    node index.js
                    node mysql.js
                    node dateTime.js
                    node users_reviews.js
2. Open a new terminal and go to the rest-api folder and initiate the command:
                     1. node index.js
3. Open another new terminal and go to the my-app folder and initiate the command:
                     1. npm start
4. Done!
